# Flocking
Python - Tkinter - Flocking - The Nature of Code

I compiled the small project inspired by The Nature of Code.
I have completed almost functions in Charpter 6 : autonomous agents.
You could directly run ./Env.py to use it.

If you wanna use all the functions, such as Flow Field, you should install additional python packages: pnoise2.
If you are interested in this project, I highly suggest you to read "The Nature of Code".

# Flocking(中文) 
参考The Nature of Code第六章：自制智能体，我基于Python Tkinter编写了Flocking程序.
内部包含了大部分功能，例如 Seek, arrive, wander, path follow, flow field, Flocking.
虽然基本没有注释，代码简单易懂，希望对你有所帮助.
你可以直接在cmd中运行 python ./Env.py
